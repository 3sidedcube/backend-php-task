# 3 Sided Cube Backend PHP Task

## About

This repository contains the 3 Sided Cube backend PHP task. We use this to assess the capabilities of PHP candidates.

## Requirements

We want you to create a temperature converter using PHP. It needs to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

This program should be run via PHP's command line interpreter. It should use the Symfony Console component.

We would like you to use PHPUnit to write supporting tests too.

We estimate this task should take you about an hour. Don't worry if you spend more or less time though, the end result is what we're interested to see!

## First Steps

* Create a new directory and initialise a Git repository
* Install your dependencies using Composer
* Create an entry point script
* Define your namespace and configure autoloading
* Start writing some PHP!

## Scope

Things you shouldn't worry about:

* Environment - You can use a local version of PHP, PHP inside a Vagrant machine, or a PHP Docker image. Choose whatever you're most comfortable with!
* Documentation - Given the small feature set you don't need to write detailed documentation. We will be able to figure out how your program works.
* Formatting - Providing you're consistent with your approach, any formatting style is fine. Sticking to a PSR is recommended though!
* Builds - You don't need to spend any time integrating build tools with repository. Automatically linting or test runners aren't required.

## Submission

Simply create a public Git repository on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. Then push your work to it and send us the link.

Alternatively, you can create a private Git repository on GitHub. Once you've pushed your work to it just add `ty3sc` as a collaborator.
